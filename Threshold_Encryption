This wikipedia page descirbes threshold cryptosystems.
They allow you to encrypt your message with several 
different people's public keys, and the message can
only be decrypted if more than a certain number of those
people cooperate to release the message. This would
mean that you can send your file out to an entire
group of people, and they can only decrypt it if more
than half of them think that the alloted time for the
dead man's switch has elapsed.
